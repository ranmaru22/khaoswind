  "Entrance Room": "The room is dark and empty. It almost looks like a cave, except that is has a certain *geometry*. It is not quite rectangular but, then again, too regular to be of natural origin. You are certain that it is man-made. Or made by some inexplainable intelligence.",
  "Large Foyer": "You are in a room that is so high you cannot see the ceiling. If it were not for the haunting darkness above you'd be sure that it had no ceiling at all. The walls of the room are narrow and, in contrast to the dauting height, almost crushing.",
  "Debris Room": "Whatever used to be in this room, it is gone now. Left of it is only rubble and trash and what seems to be remains of ... something. Yes, those are bones, you're sure of that, but they aren't exactly *human*. And you're not sure whether they're from any animal you have ever seeen.",
  "Water Chamber": "There is a small pond in the middle of the room. It seems impossibly deep and yet you can see a light coming from the inside. It draws you near, but when you step closer, you feel fear. There is something inside of it, something that might be important.",
  "Hall of Mists": "This is room 5",
  "Dark Room": "This is room 6",
  "Abandoned Shrine": "This is room 7",
  "Pit Room": "This is room 8",
  "Mysterious Cavern": "This is room 9"
