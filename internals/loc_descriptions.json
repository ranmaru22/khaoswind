  "South Main Street": [
    "You are standing in the middle of an empty street. You have the feeling that it should not be this empty. Somehow, you remember, it used to be filled with people. \n\nNow that you think about, you don't really remember how you got here. Your memory in general is a bit hazy. Maybe you drank too much last night.",
    "You are in the Southern part of Main Street. There are still no people anywhere to be seen."
  ],
  "North Main Street": [
    "You are at a crossroads. To the West is small street that looks all but deserted. To the East is a slightly bigger street from which you hear some noise. There are a few people walking around. \n\nYou know this place. You've been here before many times. There are some bars nearby.",
    "You are in the Northern part of Main Street, standing at the crossroads that lead to the bars and clubs."
  ],
  "East Side Street": [
    "You are standing in an abandoned side street. You thought that the other parts of the town were empty, but now you realize that they were packed compared to this area. There is a smell of abandonedness in the air. The place almost seems frozen in time.\n\nAnd no matter how much you think about it, you can't remember ever having been here before.",
    "You are back in the old side street, the one frozen in time. What were you doing here again?"
  ],
  "West Side Street": [
    "You have finally arrived in an area that is not awkwardly abandoned. There are bars and restaurants with some sorry excuses of neon signs all around. You are now certain that you have been here before, you even recognize some of the names on the signs.\n\nThe one that stands out is \"The Quagmire.\" You've been to that place before, recently even. There are some memories in the back of your head which try to push thenselves back from the unconscious into your active memory.",
    "You are in the bar area. There are small groups of people around, most of them seem to be looking for a place to grab some food. A few are standing in front of The Quagmire, smoking cigarettes."
