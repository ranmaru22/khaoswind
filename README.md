# K.haosPrinz und Wind-Prinzessin

### (Chaos Prince and Wind Princess)

This is a small text adventure game I am building to practice Python.
The main purpose of this game is to test some concepts, so playability
is not even the main focus. I still hope that it will come out as something
you _can_ play in the end.

Feel free to download and play and mess around with it.

As soon as this is playable, I will add some actual info about the game here.
