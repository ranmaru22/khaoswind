# K.haosPrinz und Wind-Prinzessin

**(Chaos Prince and Wind Princess)**

This is a small text adventure game I am building to practice Python.
The main purpose of this game is to test some concepts, so playability
is not even the main focus. I still hope that it will come out as something
you _can_ play in the end.

## The idea behind the game

This is basically a maze game where you have to find items in a randomly
generated map and use them to solve some riddles. Navigation is done via
simple text commands (like GO, TAKE, LOOK, etc.).

Feel free to download and play and mess around with it.

As soon as this is actually playable, I will add some actual info about the game here.
